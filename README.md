# Andrej Karpathy Guideline For Codex and Claude Code

Behavioral guidelines for Codex and Claude Code, adapted from Andrej Karpathy's observations about common LLM coding failure modes.

This repository packages the ideas in a Codex-native form by centering them around workspace instruction files such as `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

It is adapted from the original project:

- `https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills`

## Why this exists

Karpathy's critique of coding agents is still accurate across tools:

- they make hidden assumptions
- they overcomplicate simple tasks
- they touch code they were not asked to touch
- they optimize for motion instead of verifiable progress

Codex is powerful, but it also benefits from explicit local guidance. This repository gives you a small instruction file that pushes coding agents toward:

- explicit assumptions
- local inspection before editing
- simpler implementations
- surgical diffs
- verification-driven execution
- safer handling of high-risk changes

## The principles

### 1. Think Before Coding

Do not guess through ambiguity. Surface assumptions, name uncertainty, and ask when the risk of being wrong is material.

### 2. Inspect Before Editing

Read the relevant files and local conventions before making changes. Prefer project evidence over generic assumptions.

### 3. Simplicity First

Write the smallest solution that satisfies the request. Avoid speculative abstractions, unused flexibility, and premature edge-case machinery.

### 4. Surgical Changes

Touch only what the task requires. Avoid drive-by cleanup, formatting churn, and unrelated refactors.

### 5. Goal-Driven Execution

Turn tasks into verifiable goals. Prefer tests, builds, or direct checks over intuition when deciding whether work is complete.

### 6. Verify With Real Project Checks

Prefer actual repository checks such as tests, lint, type-check, and build commands over intuition. If verification cannot run, say why.

### 7. Preserve Object Boundaries

Simplifying implementation is fine. Silently collapsing distinct domain objects is not. Temporary feature reduction is usually safer than mixing ownership boundaries.

### 8. Respect Risk Boundaries

Ask before irreversible changes, dependency additions, schema or migration changes, network use, or writes outside the working area.

### 9. Keep Guidance Practical

Keep default guidance short and reusable. Put project-specific workflow details in repository-local instruction files.

## Install

Copy `AGENTS.md` into the root of the workspace you want Codex to follow:

```bash
curl -o AGENTS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobart9527/andrej-karpathy-guideline-for-codex/main/AGENTS.md
```

If you also want a Claude-compatible version in the same repository:

```bash
curl -o CLAUDE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobart9527/andrej-karpathy-guideline-for-codex/main/CLAUDE.md
```

Or append the guidance into an existing `AGENTS.md` if you already have workspace rules:

```bash
printf '\n' >> AGENTS.md
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobart9527/andrej-karpathy-guideline-for-codex/main/AGENTS.md >> AGENTS.md
```

You can do the same for an existing `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
printf '\n' >> CLAUDE.md
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobart9527/andrej-karpathy-guideline-for-codex/main/CLAUDE.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

## What "good" looks like

These guidelines are working if you see:

- fewer unnecessary lines in diffs
- more time spent reading the right files before editing
- fewer speculative abstractions
- more clarifying questions before incorrect implementation
- stronger verification before claiming success

The intent is not to change the ideas, only to package them for Codex.
